# Agentic AI Training

Welcome to the **Agentic AI Training** repository‚Äîa collection of sample code and hands-on exercises designed to explore the intersection of agent-based systems and artificial intelligence.

## üöÄ Overview

This repository serves as a practical companion to the Agentic AI training sessions. It includes a series of Python scripts and tools that demonstrate how to build and interact with intelligent agents using frameworks like Langchain and MCP (Multi-Context Processing). Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, these resources will help you understand the foundational concepts and applications of agentic AI.

## üß© Key Components

- **Article Writer Modules**: Scripts like `article_writer_autogen.py` and `article_writer_langchain_tools.py` showcase how to generate and process textual content using AI agents.
  
- **MCP Servers**: Files such as `bmi_mcp_server.py` and `math_mcp_server.py` illustrate how to set up and interact with Multi-Context Processing servers for complex data handling.

- **Langgraph Integration**: The `langgraph_with_multiple_mcp.py` and `mcp_with_langgraph.py` scripts demonstrate how to integrate Langchain with MCP servers to create sophisticated agent workflows.

- **Client Interaction**: The `mcp_client.py` script provides an example of how to communicate with MCP servers, enabling real-time data exchange and processing.

## üß™ Getting Started

To begin exploring the Agentic AI training materials:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spallya/agentic-ai-training.git
   cd agentic-ai-training
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the individual scripts to understand how each component functions and how they can be combined to build intelligent agent systems.
