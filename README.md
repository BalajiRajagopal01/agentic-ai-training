## 🚀 Overview

This repository provides a practical companion to Agentic AI training sessions. It includes Python scripts and tools that demonstrate how to build and interact with intelligent agents using frameworks like **Langchain** and **MCP (Multi-Context Processing)**.  

Whether you're a beginner or experienced developer, these resources will help you understand foundational concepts and real-world applications of agentic AI.

---

## 🧩 Key Components

- **Article Writer Modules**  
  Scripts like `article_writer_autogen.py` and `article_writer_langchain_tools.py` show how to generate and process textual content using AI agents.

- **MCP Servers**  
  Files such as `bmi_mcp_server.py` and `math_mcp_server.py` demonstrate setting up Multi-Context Processing servers for advanced data handling.

- **Langgraph Integration**  
  Scripts like `langgraph_with_multiple_mcp.py` and `mcp_with_langgraph.py` illustrate how to combine Langchain and MCP servers to create sophisticated agent workflows.

- **Client Interaction**  
  The `mcp_client.py` script demonstrates how to communicate with MCP servers for real-time data exchange and processing.
